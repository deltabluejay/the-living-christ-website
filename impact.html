                    We bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostlesâ€”that Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. He is the great King Immanuel, who stands today on the right hand of His Father. He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come. God be thanked for the matchless gift of His divine Son.

            Because of <span class="text-info">Christ</span>, everyone who has and will live has the chance to return to live with Him and Heavenly Father again. His atoning sacrifice and resurrection is the single most important thing to have ever happened in the history of the world. Because of Him, people across the world with vast cultural differences can be united as children of God with a shared faith in <span class="text-info">Christ</span> and love for each other. Through <span class="text-info">Christ</span>, we can all become better people- we can be more patient, more kind, more loving, and more understanding. <span class="text-info">Christ's</span> love for me in all of my imperfection and inadequacy inspires me to want to love others like He does. Focusing on <span class="text-info">Christ</span> helps me see others the way He does and want to comfort those that are struggling. I have a testimony that <span class="text-info">Christ</span> is our loving Savior and has been and is always there to teach and bless those that are willing to hear His message. He wants us to turn to Him so that we may receive eternal life and happiness.
