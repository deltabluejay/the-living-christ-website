        The influence of <span class="text-info">Christ</span> extends to our time today. Through Joseph Smith He restored the true Church and the fullness of His gospel. He directs our prophet, President Neslon, today. We can hear Christ through the voice of our leaders and through each other as we tune ourselves to the Spirit.

              Today I would like to speak about how we can draw into our lives the power of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.
              We begin by learning about Him. "It is impossible for [us] to be saved in ignorance." The more we know about the Savior's ministry and mission—the more we understand His doctrine and what He did for us—the more we know that He can provide the power that we need for our lives.

              The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.

        <span class="text-info">Christ</span> is the central tenet of our religion. Only through Him are we able to be saved. By learning about Him and coming to understand Him better, we will become closer to Him, become more like Him, and ultimately receive forgiveness for our sins and receive eternal life.
