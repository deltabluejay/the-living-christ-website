        <span class="text-info">Christ</span> cares about all His people, in all parts of the world. After His resurrection, He came to the Americas to teach the Nephites and Lamanites what He taught the people in Israel. In multiple places, in both the Book of Mormon and the Bible, Christ mentions going to see all His other people and the lost tribes of Israel. I believe He visited many more peoples than just the Isaelites and the Nephites/Lamanites. His Atonement is for all of mankind, and He would have wanted to teach His gospel and His triumph over death to all of His children.
